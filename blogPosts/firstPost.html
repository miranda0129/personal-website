    We should stop using the words social media and "the internet" interchangably. Here's why: the internet is so much more than that.
    <br>
    Kind of like those phones Facebook sends to devloping countries. The phones are Facebook tweaked versions of Android, pre-loaded with Facebook front and center.
    To these people just getting introdiuced to smart phones and the internet. They think Facebook <i>is the internet</i>. 
    It's not, Facebook is just <i>on the internet</i>.
    <br>
    If knowledge is power, the internet is the most powerful tool in the world.
    And that's not even speaking directly about computers because again, computer and internet are not interchangable terms; they are <i>different</i>.
